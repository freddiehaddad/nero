//! Translated from `src/nvim/window.c` (tractable core only).
//!
//! `window.c` is neovim's window-management/layout file (thousands of
//! lines) - almost entirely dependent on window creation/splitting/
//! closing machinery and the display pipeline, not attempted here.
//! Only the one function needed by `move.c`'s window-column-offset
//! calculations is translated (with one narrow, explicit gap - see its
//! own doc comment): `win_fdccol_count`.
//!
//! Deferred: everything else in the file.

use crate::buffer_defs::WinT;

/// Return the width, in columns, of `wp`'s `'foldcolumn'`
/// (`win_fdccol_count`).
///
/// # Panics
/// The original supports `'foldcolumn'` set to `"auto"`/`"auto:N"`,
/// which needs `fold.c`'s real `getDeepestNesting` (walking the actual
/// fold-nesting data structure, not yet translated) to compute how
/// many columns are actually needed. That specific case is not
/// silently approximated (which would produce a genuinely wrong
/// column count, unlike e.g. `mf_write`'s omitted message displays,
/// which never affect state) - it panics instead, loudly, exactly
/// where the real gap is. The common, default case (`'foldcolumn'`
/// set to a plain digit, `"0"`..`"9"`) is fully supported.
