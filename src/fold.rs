//! Translated from `src/nvim/fold.c` (tractable core only).
//!
//! `fold.c` (~3500 lines) is the manual/expr/indent/marker/syntax
//! fold-computation engine - a substantial subsystem of its own
//! (fold-tree construction/updates, `foldUpdateIEMS`'s line-scanning
//! state machine, nested fold levels, etc.), not remotely close to
//! being fully translated here.
//!
//! Translated: `foldmethodIsManual`/`foldmethodIsIndent` (pure
//! `'foldmethod'` string-prefix checks), `hasAnyFolding` (`terminal`/
//! `'foldenable'`/`foldmethodIsManual`/`w_folds`-emptiness check), and
//! the "there are no folds to find" fast path of `checkupdate`/
//! `hasFoldingWin`/`hasFolding`/`fold_info`/`lineFolded` (as
//! [`line_folded`]) - covering the overwhelmingly common case (a
//! window that has never had any fold created). Each of these
//! functions' OWN real fold-tree-searching logic (reached only when
//! `hasAnyFolding`/`w_foldinvalid` indicate folds might genuinely
//! exist) is `unimplemented!()`, matching this crate's established
//! "narrow, discrete, opt-in configuration branch" precedent
//! (`window.rs`'s `win_fdccol_count`, `indent.rs`'s
//! `get_breakindent_win`, `cursor.rs`'s `coladvance2` virtualedit
//! branch) - genuinely reachable only by a session that has actually
//! created a fold, which nothing in this crate can currently do
//! (fold-creation itself needs `foldUpdate`/`setManualFold`/etc., none
//! translated). `has_folding_win`/`has_folding` carry their full,
//! real signatures (`firstp`/`lastp`/`cache`/`infop`, as
//! `Option<&mut _>` out-parameters) even though the fast path
//! translated here never touches `firstp`/`lastp` (matching the
//! original's own behavior on this exact path) - kept for forward-
//! compatibility with the real fold-tree search once it exists,
//! avoiding a future signature change; `fold_info`/`line_folded` are
//! this widened signature's first real consumers.
//!
//! This precisely unblocks `cursor.c`'s `check_cursor_lnum`/
//! `check_cursor` (the `check_cursor_lnum` + `check_cursor_col` combo)
//! for the common no-folds case, and (via [`line_folded`])
//! `plines.c`'s `plines_win_nofill`.
//!
//! Also translated: `foldLevel` (as [`fold_level`], used by
//! `foldlevel()`) - re-examined and found its own two early-exit
//! branches (a same-line cache hit, an "undefined, mid-update"
//! sentinel) both depend on file-static variables that are ONLY ever
//! mutated by the not-yet-translated `foldUpdateIEMS`, so they
//! permanently sit at their own C static-zero-init defaults here,
//! making the ORIGINAL's own `if (invalid_top == 0) { checkupdate(...);
//! }` branch unconditionally taken - see [`fold_level`]'s own doc
//! comment for the full reasoning.
//!
//! Deferred: everything else (fold creation/opening/closing, the
//! `foldUpdateIEMS` scanning engine, `foldtext`, `:fold`-family
//! ex-commands), `get_cursor_rel_lnum` (`cursor.c` - its own "no
//! folds" fast path is a one-liner given `hasAnyFolding` now exists,
//! left for `cursor.rs` itself to pick up alongside
//! `check_cursor_lnum`/`check_cursor`).
